This code uses the pyautogui library to simulate mouse 
movements and clicks to open the browser, navigate to the 
Google Drive website, and select the files in the 
ClientModified folder for upload. Please note that this 
is just a starting point, and you may need to customize 
it based on your specific requirements and the details 
of your system's configuration.
